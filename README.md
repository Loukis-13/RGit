# RGit
RGit is a simple Ruby implementation of Git used to learn the basics of Ruby and learn how Git internals work.

The purpose is not to be a robust or production-ready tool, but simply to get the grasp of Ruby. It was made with base on the [Thoughbot - Rebuilding Git in Ruby](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/rebuilding-git-in-ruby) article, great part of the original code was refactored and restructured.

## Support
RGit currently implements the following commands:

* init
* add
* commit

## Execution
To execute the scripts [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) needs to be installed in your system

```bash
./rgit <command>
# or
ruby rgit <command>
```
